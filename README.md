This repository aims to compare CNN (CAM) and ViT (attention rollout) explainability output. 

Main goals:
1. Environment setup, getting used to template style.
2. Implement CAM for CNN (single iteration).
3. Implement attention rollout for ViT (single iteration).
4. Training both models on defect detection datasets.
5. Compare the results based on conventional and custom metrics.
